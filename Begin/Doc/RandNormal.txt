I'm in the situation where I need to generate both uniform random numbers in the range [i,j] as well as normally distributed numbers in that range (or at least such that 98% of the random numbers fit into that range). Computing the mean of the uniform distribution is not difficult, so now I have a mean and a range - but I need the final parameter, the standard deviation in order to generate all my random numbers. 
You need to find out, which function in Python gives you the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#Cumulative_distribution_function The cummulative distribution function of the normal distribution is often called "Фита" 
and it gives you the percentage of normally distributed random numbers up to a certain z-value. The inverse should give you the z-value to a certain percentage.
See the red curve in the above linked Wikipedia article: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Normal_Distribution_CDF.svg
Apparently the corresponding Python function is norm.ppf() in scipy.stats : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24695174/python-equivalent-of-qnorm-qf-and-qchi2-of-r
	 There is a range [i,j] given and you look for a mean and a standard deviation, so that 98% of the random numbers fall into this range. The mean is easily 
computed as mean=(i+j)/2 You can use the above mentioned functions to calculate a z-value, so that mean?z?sd=i and mean+z?sd=j This allows for easy computation the standard deviation sd.
If you choose such ? that makes 98% of normally distributed values fall into (alpha,beta) interval (i.e. "мю"±2.33"сигма"), then since your data would come from truncated normal distribution, this would obviously lead to situation where 100% of generated values fall into the prespecified range.
